Part 1: 

Step 1: Go to www.github.com, you must create an account for GitHub.

Step 2: You must create a new repository and make it public and online. 

Step 3: Once the repository is ready, create HTML and CSS files either on GitHub itself or on another application of your choice. Canvas recommends 
Webstorm, but I'd rather stick with my own IDE. I personally use Notepad++.

Step 4: Once your files are ready, upload them to the repository and now the files are online.

Part 2:

Branch: An isolated workspace that allows you to make changes without affecting other workspaces.

Clone: A copy of a repository on your local machine

Commit: Saves changes that you've made in your branch

Fetch: Retrieves work from another repository, but but doesn't integrate it into your own branches.

GIT: A version control system that is installed locally on your machine so that you can manage your source code history.

Github: A version control system that hosts files on the cloud and lets you manage giit repositories.

Merge: Megers multiple commits into one branch.

Merge Conflict: A conflict that occurs when there are two or more competing commits, such as multiple changes to the same line of code or when one commit edits a file and another commit deletes the same file.

Push: Uploads the local branch commits to a remote branch

Pull: Combines fetch and merge. Updates your local repository with changes from the remote repository

Remote: A version of your repository that's hosted on a server

Repository: Where you store your code, files, and revision history.
